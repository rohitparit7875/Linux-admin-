Good morning sir/madam,
My name is Rohit Madolappa Parit. I have completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Sveri’s College of Engineering with a 9.03 CGPA.
Recently, I completed my internship in System Security, where I gained hands-on experience in Computer Networking, Windows and Linux troubleshooting, DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP, and basic network security concepts.
I also have practical exposure to Active Directory basics, system configuration, vulnerability scanning tools, and CI/CD pipeline implementation using Jenkins and Docker. During my academic projects, I worked on a Shop Management System using SQL Server and ASP.NET MVC, which improved my understanding of databases and system-level troubleshooting.
I am comfortable working with Windows and Linux operating systems, handling user issues, and providing technical support. I am a quick learner, calm under pressure, and enjoy solving technical problems.
I am looking for an opportunity as a Desktop Support Engineer where I can apply my troubleshooting skills and grow in the IT infrastructure domain.
Thank you.
